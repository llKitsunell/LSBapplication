# LSB Steganography Project

## Overview
This project provides a two-part application designed to handle secure data storage and retrieval using steganography. It includes a program for teachers to embed sensitive data (e.g., student scores) into an image and a program for students to extract and decrypt their specific data.

The main functionalities include:
1. **Teacher Program**: Encrypts CSV data and embeds it into an image.
2. **Student Program**: Decrypts the embedded data and retrieves specific information based on a unique student ID and password.

## Features
### Teacher Program
- Encrypts sensitive data from a CSV file.
- Allows the teacher to select specific fields to be displayed.
- Embeds encrypted data and student passwords into an image using steganography.
- Generates random passwords for each student.

### Student Program
- Retrieves the encrypted data from an image.
- Decrypts data using a predefined key.
- Verifies access using a student ID and password.
- Displays only the allowed fields as configured by the teacher.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - tkinter
  - csv
  - json
  - cryptography
  - stegano
  - pillow

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install cryptography stegano pillow
```

## How to Use
### Teacher Program
1. Run `teacher.py`.
2. Select an image and a CSV file.
3. Choose which fields to display and specify the student ID field.
4. Generate random passwords and embed data into the image.
5. Save the steganographed image and the encryption key.

### Student Program
1. Run `student.py`.
2. Select the steganographed image.
3. Enter your student ID and password.
4. View your specific data as configured by the teacher.

## Known Issues
- Duplicate field names in the CSV header may cause unexpected behavior when selecting fields to display. Ensure headers are unique.

## File Structure
- `teacher.py`: Script for the teacher program.
- `student.py`: Script for the student program.
- `encryption_key.key`: Stores the encryption key generated by the teacher program.
- `display_config.json`: Configuration file for selected display fields.
- `studentid_config.json`: Configuration file for selected student ID.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve handling of duplicate field names in CSV headers.
- Add error messages for invalid inputs.
- Extend support for additional data formats.

## Credits
This project was developed as part of an educational initiative to explore cryptography and steganography concepts.
